# DevOps Learning Lab

Personal repository for experimenting with various DevOps tools, Kubernetes manifests, and deployment automation scripts.

## What's Inside

### Kubernetes Manifests
- **Service Templates**: Generic K8s service configurations and examples
- **Database Deployments**: PostgreSQL and other database setups
- **React App Deployments**: Frontend application manifests
- **Service Backups**: Saved configurations from real deployments

### Automation Scripts
- **Deployment Scripts**: Automated deployment workflows
- **Cleanup Scripts**: Resource cleanup and maintenance
- **Service Discovery**: K8s service discovery utilities

### Documentation
- Service deployment guides
- Database deployment instructions
- Step-by-step setup procedures

## Quick Start

Most scripts are executable and ready to use:
```bash
cd generic-kube-manifests/

# Deploy a service
./deploy-service.sh

# Deploy database
./deploy-database.sh

# Deploy React app
./deploy-react-app.sh

# Cleanup resources
./cleanup-service.sh
./cleanup-database.sh
```

## Purpose

This is my playground for:
- Learning Kubernetes concepts
- Testing deployment strategies
- Experimenting with DevOps automation
- Building reusable templates and scripts

Nothing fancy, just hands-on learning and experimentation!
